      <h2>Code of Coduct</h2>
      <p>
        All workshop attendees are expected to abide by the
        <a href="https://docushare.lsst.org/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-28973/NoContent2461049852211920670.txt">LSST Meetings Code Of Conduct</a>.
        This includes, but is not limited to, the following principles:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <div>
            <h4>Raise All Voices</h4>
            <p>
              During sessions and discussions, pay attention to who is contributing.
              Invite contributions from quieter members of the group, and be conscientious of not dominating the
              conversation. We understand that it can be exciting to discuss a new idea, but always
              strive to listen (rather than just wait your turn to speak).
            </p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            <h4>No Feigning Surprise</h4>
            <p>
              In an environment where participants have different backgrounds and knowledge, it
              is very important that people feel comfortable saying “I don’t know” or “I don’t
              understand.” Therefore, please do not act surprised when someone says they don’t
              know something, whether it is regarding a technical or non-technical subject (e.g.
              “What?! I can’t believe you don’t know what X is!”). Quoting from Recurse: "Feigning
              surprise has absolutely no social or educational benefit: When people feign surprise,
              it's usually to make them feel better about themselves and others feel worse. And
              even when that's not the intention, it's almost always the effect."
            </p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            <h4>No Well-Actually's</h4>
            <p>
              As defined by Recurse, "A 'well-actually' happens when someone says something
              that's almost (but not entirely) correct, and you say, 'well, actually...' and then give a
              minor correction.” Well-actually’s interrupt the discussion and fixate on a minor,
              usually irrelevant point, often solely to make the person delivering the well-actually
              feel more important. If you feel the need to correct someone, take a moment to
              consider whether your correction is in the spirit of truth-seeking, and whether it will
              provide a positive contribution to the discussion.
            </p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            <h4>No -isms</h4>
            <p>
              We explicitly ban racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and other kinds of bias—
              whether these behaviors are overt or subtle. If someone points out that you
              have engaged in this behavior, it can be tempting to become defensive— but instead,
              we ask that you apologize, reflect a moment, and move on.
            </p>
          </div>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Violations of the code of conduct should be reported to the workshop organizers.</p>
